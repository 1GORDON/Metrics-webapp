# Metrics-webapp

In this project, I achieved the following

- Built a web application to check a list of metrics with React and Redux.
- The data retrieved from the API is stored in the Redux store.
- Filtered the data retrieved from the API using a Filter stateless component.
- Every page has a unique route within the SPA.
- Added unit tests.
- Deployed the project.
